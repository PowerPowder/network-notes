# Wide Area Networks

## Wired WAN Connections
* **Dedicated Leased Line**: unshared dedicated connection through service provider's facility
* **Circuit-Switched**: connection brought up when needed, like a phone call
* **Packet-Switched**: always on dedicated lease line but with multiple customers
    * **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: guarantee certain quality (5mbps, at least 80% of the time)
* **WAN Physical Media**: copper wires (UTP, STP, Coaxial), fibre-optic, electric power lines

## Wireless WAN Connections
* **Cellular (Phones and Hot Spots)**:
    * 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G (low/mid/high bands, higher = less coverage)
    * **Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)**: converts voice to digital during a call, uses SIM card
    * **Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**: splits up channel with code division, calls encoded with unique key
* **Microwave**: beam of radio waves transmitted between two fixed locations, antennas require line of sight
    * WiMax - antenna installed on roof, faster than 2G, 3G, 3.5G
    * Satellite - slow, expensive, high latency connection, used for remote areas, flights and ships
    * High-Frequency Radio - very slow connection, used in disaster relief and military scenarios
